Welcome to my personal Java array practice repository!  
This is where I’m learning, exploring, and improving my understanding of **arrays in Java** — starting from the basics and slowly moving to intermediate and advanced topics.

I'm building this step-by-step as I learn, and updating it regularly.

📌 My Goals
- ✅ Understand basic array operations
- ✅ Practice common interview-style problems
- 🔄 Learn different problem-solving approaches
- ⏳ Keep track of my progress

📚 Topics I'm Practicing

✅ Basics
1. Printing array elements
2. Calculating sum of array elements
3. Finding out maximum and minimum number from array elements
